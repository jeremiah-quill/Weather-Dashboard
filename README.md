Welcome to my Weather Dashboard! This app is designed to present the user with current and forecasted weather data for a searched city.  When the user searches for a city in the input field, after a few keystrokes the app will give suggestions on what city the user is looking for.  After clicking on a city, the user is presented with current detailed weather data, as well as a more condensed view of a 5 day forecast for that city.  The app utilizes Mapbox, a geocoding API, to turn the searched city into a latitude and longitude which is then used in the Open Weather Map API to access current and forecasted weather data

Features of the app include:

* autocomplete style dropdown of suggested cities after 3 keystrokes
* search history shown with the most recent searches at the top, saving the last 10 on screen and in local storage for quick access
* dynamically colored UV Index based on how high it is
* weather icons dynamically rendered based on current and forecasted conditions

The following is a screenshot of the finished product:
